# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully deployed and managed a multi-container Docker application using Terraform. Let's revise the Intended Learning Outcomes to see if we have met our goals.

The current infrastructure configured by Terraform is visualized below

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- *Understand the basics of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its benefits*
	- You have learned what Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is and how it can help you manage and provision your infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. This was achived by using Terraform to define and manage Docker containers for quick and easy teardown and redeployment of the entire environment.
- *Install and configure Docker and Terraform on your machine*
	- If you didn't skip the optional steps you should now have learned how to configure and build Docker images. You have also learned how to install and configure Terraform and the basics of how to use it.

- *Create and manage Docker containers using Terraform*
	- You have learned how to define Docker containers in a Terraform configuration file and how to deploy and manage them using Terraform commands.

- *Configure a simple network monitoring setup using Snort and an HTTP server*
	- You have learned how to set up a simple network monitoring environment using Snort as the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and a basic HTTP server to view alerts. This simulates a real-world network monitoring setup.

- *Understand how to trigger and view Snort alerts through the HTTP server*
	- You have learned how to generate network traffic that triggers Snort alerts and how to view these alerts through the HTTP server.

## Aquired Skills
You should now be able to apply these concepts to more complex scenarios, for example, by adding more services and scale the network environment by using Terraform for easy deployment. This tutorial has provided you insight into the benefits of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and can be used in your future projects to manage and provision infrastructure efficiently.
